## Notes

A challenge I encountered was thoroughly understanding template literals properly. Although I do have prior experience using them, it completely left my mind that they have to be enclosed by backticks, and that quotation marks don't work, but I was able to get around that hurdle after reading the description closely and referring to MDN Web Docs.

Another challenge I faced was understanding the notation for the spread operator and applying it properly in the index.js file. The spread operator reminded me of the power that JavaScript has in copying one object to produce another modified version of it. It makes your code much more efficient and easy to use rather. As someone who has often used a for loop copying certain array elements, I was glad to remember and get familiar again with the spread operator.
